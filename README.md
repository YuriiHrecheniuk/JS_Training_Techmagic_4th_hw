## Fourth homework

The task was to create some Angular application to interact with movies through API. I made a simple site on which you can: 
- get a random movie to watch on the _Home_ tab
- search for a show information on the _Search_ tab
- get list of trending movies weekly


Reference to API documentation: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
To get your own API key, you need to simply authorize on https://www.themoviedb.org/ and then go to settings -> API tab
and generate you api_key

To start the project, clone it to your project directory, run __npm i__ and then run __ng serve__

Enjoy!
